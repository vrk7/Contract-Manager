## How to Use This Playbook

This document defines **acceptable ranges** for common contract terms. When analyzing a contract:

1. **Extract** the relevant term from the contract
2. **Compare** against the acceptable range in this playbook
3. **Classify** risk level based on deviation
4. **Recommend** specific remediation

## Risk Level Definitions

| Level          | Definition                                                             | Action Required                           |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Critical**   | Unacceptable terms that expose significant liability or cash flow risk | Must renegotiate before signing           |
| **High**       | Terms that deviate significantly from market standard                  | Strongly recommend renegotiation          |
| **Medium**     | Terms outside preferred range but within tolerable limits              | Flag for awareness, negotiate if possible |
| **Low**        | Minor deviations from ideal terms                                      | Accept with documentation                 |
| **Acceptable** | Within standard market range                                           | No action needed                          |

---

## 1. Payment Terms

### 1.1 Payment Period

| Parameter         | Acceptable | Medium Risk | High Risk  | Critical |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Days from invoice | 30-45 days | 46-60 days  | 61-90 days | >90 days |

**Market Context:** VOB/B standard is 30 days. International FIDIC allows up to 56 days.

**Risk Rationale:** Extended payment terms create cash flow strain, especially for subcontractors. Terms >60 days often indicate owner cash flow issues.

**Recommended Language:**

> "Payment shall be made within thirty (30) days of receipt of a proper invoice."

---

### 1.2 Retainage / Retention

| Parameter       | Acceptable                | Medium Risk         | High Risk            | Critical              |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Percentage held | 5%                        | 6-10%               | 11-15%               | >15%                  |
| Release timing  | At substantial completion | At final completion | 30+ days after final | >90 days or undefined |

**Market Context:** German market standard is 5%. Some owners push for 10%.

**Risk Rationale:** High retainage ties up working capital. Unclear release terms create disputes.

**Recommended Language:**

> "Retainage of five percent (5%) shall be released within fourteen (14) days of substantial completion, subject to submission of warranty bonds."

---

### 1.3 Payment Conditions

| Condition                                                     | Risk Level | Notes                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Payment contingent on owner receiving funds ("pay-when-paid") | High       | May be unenforceable in Germany                      |
| Payment only for pre-approved work                            | Medium     | Acceptable if approval process is defined            |
| No payment for disputed work                                  | High       | Should allow partial payment for undisputed portions |
| Payment subject to lien waivers                               | Low        | Standard practice                                    |

---

## 2. Change Orders / Variations

### 2.1 Change Order Process

| Parameter                     | Acceptable                  | Medium Risk             | High Risk               | Critical                      |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Written approval required     | Yes                         | -                       | Verbal OK               | No process defined            |
| Pricing agreement before work | Required                    | "Best efforts"          | Work first, price later | Owner sets price unilaterally |
| Time extension included       | Automatic with scope change | Must request separately | Must prove impact       | No extensions for changes     |

**Risk Rationale:** Unclear change order processes are the #1 source of construction disputes.

---

### 2.2 Delay / Change Notification Period

| Parameter                | Acceptable         | Medium Risk                   | High Risk            | Critical                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Notice period            | 14-21 days         | 7-13 days                     | 4-6 days             | ≤3 days                      |
| Notice format            | Written (email OK) | Written (certified mail only) | Registered mail only | -                            |
| Waiver of claims if late | No waiver clause   | Partial waiver                | Full waiver          | Full waiver + no cure period |

**Market Context:** VOB/B requires "immediate" notice but courts interpret this as ~14 days.

**Risk Rationale:** Short notice periods are often missed in fast-moving projects, leading to waived claims worth millions.

**Recommended Language:**

> "Contractor shall provide written notice of any delay or change impact within fourteen (14) calendar days of becoming aware of such impact. Failure to provide timely notice shall not constitute waiver of claims but may be considered in evaluating claim validity."

---

### 2.3 Owner-Directed Changes

| Scenario                         | Acceptable               | High Risk                       | Critical                               |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Owner can direct changes         | Yes, with agreed pricing | Yes, pricing determined later   | Yes, contractor cannot dispute pricing |
| Work must proceed during dispute | No                       | Yes, with reservation of rights | Yes, with no reservation               |
| Disputed costs                   | Mediation/arbitration    | Owner's decision is preliminary | Owner's decision is final              |

## 3. Indemnification

### 3.1 Scope of Indemnification

| Scope                                             | Risk Level | Notes                          |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| Limited to contractor's negligence                | Acceptable | Standard, insurable            |
| Includes contractor's proportionate fault         | Acceptable | Fair allocation                |
| Broad form (any claims arising from work)         | High       | May exceed insurance coverage  |
| "Regardless of fault" / includes owner negligence | Critical   | Often uninsurable, may be void |

**Legal Context:** "Broad form" indemnification covering owner's own negligence is void in several German states and uninsurable in most cases.

---

### 3.2 Indemnification Limits

| Limit                          | Risk Level |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- |
| Capped at contract value       | Acceptable |
| Capped at insurance limits     | Acceptable |
| Limited to direct damages      | Acceptable |
| Unlimited                      | High       |
| Includes consequential damages | Critical   |

**Recommended Language:**

> "Contractor shall indemnify Owner for claims arising from Contractor's negligent acts or omissions, limited to Contractor's proportionate fault and capped at the greater of the Contract Sum or Contractor's insurance coverage."

---

## 4. Termination

### 4.1 Termination for Convenience

| Parameter                      | Acceptable           | Medium Risk              | High Risk          | Critical     |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------ |
| Notice period                  | 30+ days             | 14-29 days               | 7-13 days          | <7 days      |
| Payment for completed work     | Full payment         | Payment less admin costs | Owner's discretion | No guarantee |
| Payment for materials on order | Full reimbursement   | Reasonable costs         | Nothing            | -            |
| Lost profit recovery           | Reasonable allowance | Negotiated               | None               | -            |

**Risk Rationale:** Short-notice termination for convenience can strand contractors with committed resources and no recourse.

---

### 4.2 Termination for Cause

| Parameter             | Acceptable                   | High Risk                            | Critical                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Cure period           | 14+ days                     | 7 days                               | No cure period          |
| Definition of "cause" | Specific, objective criteria | Vague ("unsatisfactory performance") | Owner's sole discretion |
| Dispute rights        | Can contest termination      | Limited appeal                       | No contest              |

| ------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| Negotiation → Mediation → Arbitration | Acceptable | Industry standard              |
| Negotiation → Arbitration             | Low        | Skips mediation, still fair    |
| Direct to arbitration                 | Medium     | No informal resolution attempt |
| Direct to litigation                  | Medium     | Expensive but transparent      |
| Owner's decision final                | Critical   | No neutral review              |

| Contractor's jurisdiction                | Low        | Favorable to contractor      |
| Owner's jurisdiction (different country) | High       | Travel costs, unfamiliar law |
