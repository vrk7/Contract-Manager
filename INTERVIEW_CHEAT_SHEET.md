# VOIDS Interview - Quick Cheat Sheet
*Review 15 minutes before the interview*

---

## Your Opening (60 seconds)

"I'm a full-stack engineer who builds production AI systems. I recently deployed a contract clause analyzer using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, React + TypeScript, and RAG pipelines - it's live at http://35.178.58.160.

What excites me about VOIDS is the parallel challenge: you're taking complex forecasting data and making it actionable for D2C brands making critical inventory decisions. I've done the same - taking complex legal analysis and distilling it into clear risk scores.

I've been building systems since 2019 at Capgemine, Sony, and Kontex. I thrive in fast-paced, AI-driven cultures that ship daily and learn from customers."

## Your 3 Key Strengths

1. **Complex Data → Simple UI**
   - Contract analyzer: SSE streaming, risk scoring, playbook retrieval
   - Voice agent: sub-400ms latency, real-time processing
   - "I break down complexity into actionable UX"

2. **Full-Stack + AI/ML Expertise**
   - TypeScript, React, PostgreSQL, FastAPI
   - Claude API, RAG pipelines, vector embeddings
   - "I speak both product and ML"

3. **Ownership & Shipping**
   - Designed, built, deployed, maintain production systems
   - AWS EC2, Docker, monitoring, user feedback
   - "I own features end-to-end"

## Tech Stack Match

| VOIDS Stack | Your Experience | Confidence |
|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| TypeScript | ✅ Recent migration, production use | 8/10 |
| Next.js 15 | ⚠️ Strong React, learn fast | 7/10 |
| PostgreSQL | ✅ Current project, async queries | 9/10 |
| TailwindCSS | ⚠️ CSS fundamentals strong | 6/10 |
| Drizzle ORM | ⚠️ SQLAlchemy experience translates | 7/10 |

**Key message:** "I learn frameworks fast - I haven't used Next.js 15 specifically, but I have strong React fundamentals and picked up FastAPI, ChromaDB, and Docker orchestration in weeks for my contract analyzer."

## Your Best Project Stories

### Story 1: Streaming Complex Data (Contract Analyzer)
**Challenge:** Users need real-time feedback on complex contract analysis
**Solution:** Built SSE streaming with structured JSON events - findings appear incrementally
**Impact:** Better UX than batch results, users see progress
**VOIDS parallel:** "Forecasts should stream too - show inventory risks as they're calculated"

### Story 2: 50% Latency Reduction (Kontex.dev)
**Challenge:** Slow inference blocking user workflows
**Solution:** Vector indexing optimization, async processing
**Impact:** 50% reduction in end-to-end latency
**VOIDS parallel:** "Forecast generation needs similar optimization for large SKU catalogs"

### Story 3: Playbook Versioning (Contract Analyzer)
**Challenge:** Need audit trails for B2B trust
**Solution:** Immutable playbook versions, track which version per analysis
**Impact:** Users can see exactly why recommendations were made
**VOIDS parallel:** "VOIDS customers need to trust forecasts - showing which patterns informed predictions builds confidence"

## Questions to Ask (Pick 3-4)

**Technical:**
1. "You're migrating NestJS → Next.js fullstack - what's driving that?"
2. "How do you handle real-time forecast updates when new sales data comes in?"
3. "What does your forecasting model architecture look like?"

**Product:**
4. "What's been the hardest data visualization challenge?"
5. "How do you build confidence in forecasts with customers used to manual planning?"

**Culture:**
6. "You ship daily with lightweight consultation - how do you balance autonomy with alignment?"
7. "What's the most technically interesting problem in the next 3-6 months?"

**Growth:**
8. "Doubling ARR by 2025 - which technical capabilities need to scale first?"

## Handle Objections

**"Your recent work is Python-heavy"**
→ "I've used TypeScript in production and recently migrated my contract analyzer. TypeScript makes me more productive - catching bugs at compile time. I'm excited to work TypeScript-first."

**"No e-commerce experience?"**
→ "My enterprise SaaS experience translates - B2B users need reliability and audit trails whether it's finance or inventory. Fresh perspective can uncover better solutions."

**"No Next.js 15 experience?"**
→ "Strong React fundamentals - hooks, state management, server-side concepts. I learn fast: picked up FastAPI, ChromaDB, Docker orchestration in weeks."

## Closing Statement

"I'm genuinely excited about VOIDS. You're solving a real problem - stockouts directly impact D2C bottom lines. My background building data-heavy systems with simple UIs, my AI/ML expertise, and my track record of owning features end-to-end align perfectly.

I'm ready to contribute from day one - whether that's optimizing forecasting pipelines, building better visualizations, or improving developer experience. When can I start?"
